Found a bug? Please feel empowered to create a new issue in this repository.
Please include as much detail as you can (e.g. is the bug on mobile? On desktop?
What browser? How can you replicate it?). Screenshots are incredibly helpful!


## Feature Requests

If you have an idea about a feature to add to the app, feel free to create a new
issue as well! Again, please include as much detail as you can, and most
importantly, _why_ you think the feature would be a positive addition.


## Code Contributions

Please feel free to submit new PRs to existing issues. If you'd like to work on
something that isn't tracked by issues, please create a new issue first. All
code contributions should ensure the test suite passes locally when running
